First loading data in COO format such that tiling works. 
Does 2D tile goes row by row ? Does each 2D tile have the same size?
Should each tile include only one element in each row because ofthe data race?
How should I set padding for 2D tile?
The length of colmun, row, and weight vectors change depending on the
number of paddings?

non-zeros are not row by row 
size of each tile is the same 
length of weight vector is larger than actual 
dummy element is accessing the real data 

16 consecutive elements shouldn't come from the same row for row index array

iterate over all numbers pick 16 numbers once you see the same, skip. 

First do tiling to create the row array. then do grouping(reordering row array) so that 16 consecutive
elemements don't come from the same row.
